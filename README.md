A modification of Adafruit's  Trinket Powered Rover to function as a tabletop scale RC tank

The Adafruit Trinket Rover ( https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-powered-rover/red-rover ) is a cool starter project. The only drawback is that the treads are those woven wrist bands and I can't find them cheaply. I've created a replacement drive wheel and idler that mimic the same design, but instead take standard silicone wrist bands that are readily available on online retailers like Amazon.

These wrist bands are typically available in two sizes- youth (7.5 cm) and adult (8 cm). I have only tried this with the YOUTH size. If you try this with the adult size, your mileage may vary.
